In the [previous post]({% post_url 2025-10-30-teaching-kids-math-arcsin-law-1 %}), We talked about the intuition behind the Arcsin Law and my attempt to explain it to my daughter. People say a picture is worth a thousand words, so I made a video about it because a video is a thousand pictures (haha, sorry). In this post, I will discuss how to use simulation to teach Monte Carlo simulations to children.
