In the [previous post](https://steveya.github.io/posts/teaching-kids-math-arcsin-law-1/), We talked about the intuition behind the Arcsin Law and my attempt to explain it to my daughter. People say a picture is worth a thousand words, so I made a video about it because a video is a thousand pictures (haha, sorry). In this post, I will discuss how to use simulation to teach Monte Carlo simulations to children.
