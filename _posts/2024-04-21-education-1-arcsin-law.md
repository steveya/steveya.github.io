# Education For Children Series
Ever since my first child, I have been learning how to teach children about mathematics. In particular, mathematics that I did not learn about at school when I was a child, but I knew I would have grasped it at that age had someone introduced me to it. I started a video series to put them on YouTube to share with others. This is a learning experience for me as well because I am still struggling with introducing my chosen concepts, assuming only grade school mathematics, and learning how to make YouTube videos. I also only have a little time; the children are growing fast...

I decided to start by making videos using the Manim library (from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown)) since it is how I learn a lot of math topics on YouTube. I am still on the fence about using it for this purpose because I would be using an unfamiliar tool (Manim) for an unfamiliar task (teaching children.) It might be easier to do what [Aleph 0](https://www.youtube.com/@Aleph0) does using cardboards. However, I am torn because I am thinking about mainly using simulations to teach some topics engagingly (and under 10 minutes in total).

In these posts, I will mainly discuss the ideas I want to teach my children and brainstorm ways to implement them. I will also discuss the challenges I faced when trying to teach them and how I overcame them. When a video is made, I will post a link here, too.

## Topic 1 - Arcsin Law
One night, I was helping my daughter with her math homework. It was about how to build a histogram from counting data and produce simple summary statistics. Then this idea hit me: Histograms are a gateway topic to probability and statistics, and there are lots of counterintuitive probability distributions out there. I want to teach my daughter about the Arcsin law!
