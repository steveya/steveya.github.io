# Education For Children Series
Ever since I have my first child, I have been learning about how to teach children about mathematics. In particular, mathematics that I did not learn about at school when I was a child, but I knew I would have grasped it at that age had someone introduced me to it. I decided to start a video series with the aim to put them on YouTube to share with others. This is as much a learning experience for me as well, because I am still struggling with both the way to introduce my chosen concepts assuming only grade school mathematics, and, well, learning how to make YouTube videos. I also don't have too much time, the children are growing up so fast...

I decided to start with making videos using the Manim library (from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown)), since it is how I learn a lot of math topics on YouTube. I am still on the fence about actually using it for this purpose, because I would be using an unfamiliar tool (Manim) for an unfamiliar task (teaching children.) It might be easier if I do what [Aleph 0](https://www.youtube.com/@Aleph0) does using cardboards. However, as i am thinking about using mostly simluations to teach some topics in an engaging manner (and under 10 minutes in total) I am torn.

In these posts I will mostly talk about the ideas I want to teach my children, and brainstorm about ways to implement them. I will also talk about the challenges I faced when trying to teach them, and how I overcame them. When a video is made, I will post a link here too.

## Topic 1 - Arcsin Law
One night I was helping my daughter with her math homework. It was about how to build a histogram from counting data and produce simple summary statistics. Then this idea hits me. Histogram is a gateway topic to probability and statistics, and there are lots of counter-intuitive probability distributions out there. I want to teach my daughter about the arcsin law!
