The following is a list of my past and present projects. Each project consists of a title, a brief description, and a link to the project's GitHub repository. I will be updating this list as I continue to work on new projects.

Projects marked with Work in Progress (WIP) are still in progress and may not be fully functional.

## Volatility Forecasting

## Short Rate Models
I have been planning on writing a series on some of the interesting short-rate models that I have encountered in the past. There are just so many models that it is impossible to cover them all. If you have any suggestions, please let me know!

## Teaching Kids Math
I have been teaching kids math ever since I have kids. I want to start writing down some of them and made them into videos if possible. I need a lot of help with the video part...
