I am a quantitative researcher and portfolio manager with extensive experience in finance. My passion lies in learning new things and applying my skills across different domains, primarily using machine learning and statistical methods. I am particularly interested in pursuing opportunities in quantitative finance or machine learning, where I can leverage my expertise to solve complex problems.

In addition to my professional work, I am dedicated to making complex concepts accessible, especially for my two daughters. My side project involves teaching children, mostly my daughters, fundamental ideas from mathematics and computer science, nurturing their curiosity and understanding.
